FINDING NEAREST POINT
In this question, you are required to calculate the nearest point in a 2 dimensional (2D) space where each point has x and y pair. You will prompt the user by asking x and y coordinate of a point P, then you will find the index of the nearest point in the stored arrays. 

NOTE: DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ARRAYS! YOU WILL JUST ACCESS THE VALUES INSIDE THE ARRAYS.



Specifications

1. Points are stored in two integer arrays which one array stores x coordinates and other stores y coordinates. 

In this representation, the coordinates of the first point is stored in xcoors[0] and ycoors[0] in a corresponding manner and other points similarly. 

2. Points array will be given at the beginning of your program.

3. Euclidean distance will be used as distance metric. Remember that Euclidean distance between 2D points is that 

square root of ((qx - px)^2 + (qy - py)^2), where px and py are x and y coordinates of the point P respectively.



Output
In the output, first print point P, then nearest array index and distance between point P and this index. Sample output:

P = (12,30), nearest point index = 7, distance = 4.0
Please strictly obey this output format. No newline is used in output.



Note: 

- You can use functions such as sqrt, pow from math library. 

- You can use any type of loop.

- All given point coordinates are integers, show distance as float with 1 precision point.

- There are 10 points in coordinate arrays.

- If two coordinates' distances are equal, use the one with the lower index.
