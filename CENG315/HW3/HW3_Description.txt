Your archeologist friend found a scroll during her latest excavation, but unfortunately, the writing on the scroll is corrupted. She believes that the writing on the scroll may be a duplicate of an existing text. You offer to help her by writing a computer program that compares strings and tries to align them according to their similarities. You ask her for a scoring system for character comparison, and she gives you the following function:

alignment score = (# of matching characters * match score)  - (# of gaps * gap score) - (# of mismatching characters * mismatch score)
For example, if the readable sequence on the scroll is "CC", the possible match string is "CD", the match score is 4, the gap score is 1, and the mismatch score is 2, then the possible alignments between the strings and their scores are as follows:

(The character "_" denotes a gap in the first string, "." denotes a gap in the second string, and "!" denotes a mismatch.)

CC__
..CD
aligned:
..__ => alignment does not have any matches or mismatches, only gaps
gap, gap, gap, gap => (0 * 4)-(4 * 1)- (0 * 2) = 0 - 4 - 0 = -4

CC_
.CD
aligned:
.C_  => alignment has two gaps, one match, no mismatch
gap, match, gap => (1 * 4) - (2 * 1) - (0 * 2) = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2

CC
CD
aligned:
C!   => alignment has one match and one mismatch
match, mismatch => (1 * 4) - (0 * 1) - (1 * 2) = 4 - 0 - 2 = 2
_CC
CD. 
aligned:
_!.  => alignment has one mismatch and two gaps
gap, mismatch, gap => (0 * 4) - (2 * 1) - (1 * 2) = 0 - 2 - 2 = -4

__CC
CD..
aligned:
__.. => alignment does not have any matches or mismatches, only gaps
gap, gap, gap, gap => (0 * 4) - (4 * 1) - (0 * 2) = 0 - 4 - 0 = -4



Problem 

In this exam, you are asked to compare the two given sequences and find one possible alignment with the highest match score with two different approaches by completing the recursive_alignment() and dp_table_alignment() functions defined below. 


int recursive_alignment(std::string sequence_A, std::string sequence_B, int gap, int mismatch, int match, std::string &possible_alignment, int call_count);

int dp_table_alignment(std::string sequence_A, std::string sequence_B, int gap, int mismatch, int match, std::string &possible_alignment);

 


You should return the highest alignment score of the two sequences as the return value for both functions. The arguments of the function are defined as follows with their limits:

sequence_A and sequence_B are strings to be compared, with lengths <= 10000
gap is the integer penalty point for leaving a gap in the alignment, where 0 <= gap <= 10
mismatch is the integer penalty point for a mismatch in the alignment, where 0 <= mismatch <= 10
match is the integer point for a successful match in the alignment, where 0 <= match <= 10
possible_alignment is a string that includes one of the possible alignments for two sequences with the highest alignment score, where the character "_" denotes a gap in sequence_A, "." denotes a gap in sequence_B, and "!" denotes a mismatch.
call_count is an integer used to keep track of the number of recursive calls. 

Let F(i,j) denote the best alignment score when looking at index i of sequence_A and index j of sequence_B. Then, the recurrence relation of this problem can be defined as follows:

F(i,j) = max(F(i-1, j-1) + c(i,j),
             F(i-1, j) - gap,
             F(i, j-1) - gap)
where c(i,j) stands for the comparison between the characters sequence_A[i] and sequence_B[j], and returns match or -mismatch accordingly.


Constraints and Hints:

For the recursive_alignment() function you are expected to implement the given recurrence relation directly. Since this will be an inefficient solution, you need to keep track of the recursive calls. You should increment the call_count variable by 1 every time you make a recursive call, and stop the calculation if the call_count reaches 1000000. This means that you will not be able to find the optimal alignment for longer strings. If you terminate the calculation because of the call_count limit, you should update the possible_alignment string as "STACK LIMIT REACHED". In that case, the returned alignment score is not important, but you can return INT_MIN to keep track (<climits> is included in the3.h for you).
For the dp_table_alignment() function, you are expected to implement a bottom-up dynamic programming solution. When implemented correctly with a dynamic programming table, this solution should work with longer strings. 
When returning/reconstructing the alignment, it is not important which alignment you return as possible_alignment as long as it has the highest alignment score (i.e. if there are multiple solutions, you can return any of them). 
It is guaranteed that length(sequence_A) <= length(sequence_B).
sequence_A and sequence_B will consist of uppercase English characters [A-Z].
